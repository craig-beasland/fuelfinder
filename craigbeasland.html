                The Fuel Finder application was created by Craig Beasland using the RSS capabilities available on the Consumer Protection fuelwatch website.  The website is available at <a href="http://www.fuelwatch.wa.gov.au">http://www.fuelwatch.wa.gov.au</a>.  This project was designed because I had a personal need and also as a tool to learn web/html/mobile application development.
